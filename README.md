# ECL-DataViz : Stream Graph

## Description

Stream Graphs consist in a variation of a Stacked Area Graph, which means that different categories are piled in order to see the value of each one, but also its contribution to the total. In order to let that happen, different colors are often dedicated to each data. But sometimes, the color is used to show the value of the data.
So just like the Stacked Area Graph, the value of the different data are proportional to the height of the stream shape, and the horizontal axis is often the time. But what differs is that there is no fixed vertical axis to refer to.
Stream Graphs are particularly useful to analyse the trends of high-volume datasets, and they are very aesthetic. But its main drawbacks is that the smaller values are hidden in the large shapes of the higher ones. Another problem is that we can't read the exact value of datasets with these graphs, because there isn't an axis to allow that. However it can be seen as an benefit for thoses who want to focus their reader to the trends and not the values.
As a conclusion the stream graph is a very particular graph, which make him unique and therefore interesting. It's an ideal solution for people who look for aesthetics and trends representations.

## Examples

### Listening History

Lee Byron created a stream graph about his listening history with the help of Last.fm that logged the music he listened to. We can see his graph down there.
